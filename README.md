# cits4012-project-2
This project is to try out different neural language models on one NLP downsteam task: Document Classification. The same dataset from Project 1 is used again here. For example, in the structured fields, we have

Job category (category), e.g. Retail & Consumer Products, Trades and Services.
City (city), e.g. Sydney, Brisbane
Job Type (job_type), e.g. Full Time, Contract/Temp, Part Time
Most importantly and similar to other real world data, there is a Job Description (job_description) field that contains unstructured short texts describing the incident in more detail. Valuable information are trapped in this unstructured field that could be of value to decision and government policy makers to understand the job market in Australia.

In this project, we attempt to unlock the information from text narratives in this dataset through document classifications.
